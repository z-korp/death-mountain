              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of

              smart contracts, tokens, and services (collectively, the
              "Services"). The Game is created and operated by Provable Labs
              Ltd., a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands
              ("Provable Labs", "we", "our", or "us").
              <br />
              <br />
              By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these
              Terms. If you do not agree, you may not participate in Loot
              Survivor 2.
              <br />
              <br />

                  your jurisdiction, to participate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are solely responsible for ensuring that your participation
                  in Loot Survivor complies with all laws and regulations in
                  your jurisdiction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You may not participate if you are a resident of, or accessing
                  the Services from, any jurisdiction where participation would be
                  unlawful.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <strong>2. Game Mechanics</strong>

                <li>

                <li>
